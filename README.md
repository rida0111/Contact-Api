# Contacts API – Demo Project

A RESTful Web API **demo** built with **ASP.NET Core** for managing contacts.
The project implements full **CRUD** operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and follows a **layered architecture** that clearly separates concerns between the API, business logic, and data access layers.

---

## 🏗 Architecture

The solution is divided into three main layers:

* **ContactApi** → API layer
  Handles HTTP requests, controllers, routing, and DTOs.

* **Business** → Business logic layer
  Contains services, validations, and application rules.

* **Data** → Data access layer
  Responsible for database operations using SQL Server stored procedures (via EF Core / ADO.NET).

This structure improves **maintainability**, **scalability**, and **testability**.
